                I am interested in the full stack.<br><br>
                A majority of my work is done in Java and Java Swing Components, and much of my code can be found on <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: black;"><a href="https://github.com/armondluthens">github</a></span>.  I primarily work out of eclipse or netbeans, and the command line is an integral part of my life. While working on side projects on top of coursework during the academic year is tough, I believe it is absolutely necessary for becoming a well-rounded developer. I enjoy building sites for others professionally, as well as in my free time to feed my artistic voids.

                This is a site I'm doing for a yoga studio who wanted their site redone.  This is a link is to
                the working repository that I'm currently committing to, so parts may be changing or appear
                broken at any given time.  This is primarily being built on HTML5/CSS and JavaScript but more
                technologies may come into play later.  I'm really excited to roll out the final product 
                on this, and if you're ever in Clive, Iowa check out a yoga class at Spark Yoga!

                This is a blog I created for my mom to help her better reach her yoga students. It will serve
                as a personal blog for her and a place to post interesting articles, tips, and ways to improve
                at yoga. This was a really fun project to create from scratch and design. Stuck to the basics
                using HTML5/CSS and a little bit of JavaScript.  Should be some interesting content once it
                gets goin!

                This is a project that I built for one of my colleagues with a two-fold purpose of
                being a personal website to share his research, as well as to host a blog about science.
                This project was a lot of fun, and I highly suggest anyone interested in hearing about
                complex science broken in simple explanations to give it a look!

                This is my most current project that is currently being developed using an Agile Software
                Development Method.  This site is being developed with two other teammate as a prototype site
                for manufacturers to be able to buy inventory from suppliers.  The front-end is built in
                HTML/CSS and JS and will be run on a Apache Tomcat server using Java as its middle architecture. We
                also will have a functional database using a JDBC connection.  This project is still in its
                early stages so be forewarned that many parts are not functional or responsive yet.  Stay tuned
                as more rollout will come in each iteration!

                This is a website I built to organize and display a senior electrical engineering design project that I am a part of.  I am currently on a team with 3 other students at the University of Iowa and the focus of this project is to solve design problems relating to both hardware and software development.  This project site references code, designs, and an overview of our project.
